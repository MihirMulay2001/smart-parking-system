<h3 align="center">Smart Parking System</h3>

## About The Project

`This project is currently under active development`

This is a parking system built on the blockchain using crytography functions as a secure way to make payments.

Major functionality

- Any owner can register their parking spaces along with number of spacecs, charge per unit time and timeout value.
- User initially freezes maximum amount required in the smart contract so as to discourage malicious activity.
- Users can sign a messsage off chain after certain intervals of time.
- Owner can only redeem last message so as to prevent high gas fees on repeated transactions.

### Future work

I am currently working on building a decentralised oracle that will enable users to communicate with the app via devices like RFID cards or NFC scanners. This will eliminate the need for an app and would provide smoother experience.

### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

### Requirements

A wallet to interact with the app

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
